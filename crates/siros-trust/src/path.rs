//! Path validation as TR3 restricts RFC 5280, Section 6.1: an issuer chain's first certificate
//! has a path to an anchor certificate at a given time.
//!
//! A path is a prefix of the chain, each certificate signed by the next, whose last certificate
//! an anchor signs; or the chain's first certificate alone, when an anchor is byte-identical to
//! it (direct trust). TR3 applies these rules to a path:
//!
//! | Rule | RFC 5280 |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | every certificate on the path, the anchor included, is valid at the time | 6.1.3 (a)(2) |
//! | each signer's subject is the certificate's issuer, compared as DER bytes | 6.1.3 (a)(4) |
//! | each signature verifies under its signer's key: ECDSA P-256 with SHA-256 or P-384 with SHA-384, over the `tbsCertificate` as written | 6.1.3 (a)(1) |
//! | each signer is a CA | 6.1.4 (k) |
//! | at most its pathLenConstraint of non-self-issued intermediate certificates lie below a signer | 6.1.4 (l), (m) |
//! | a signer's keyUsage, when present, includes keyCertSign | 6.1.4 (n) |
//! | every certificate on the path, the anchor included, has each critical extension in the set [`extensions`](crate::extensions) processes | 6.1.4 (o) |
