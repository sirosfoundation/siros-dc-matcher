//! Issuer trust for the SIROS wallet core (§4.18): the trust store, issuer chains, and the
//! resolution of a Credential Query's `trusted_authorities` (OpenID4VP 1.0, Section 6.1.1)
//! into an admission of a credential's issuer.
//!
//! | Requirement | API |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | TR1: the store, constructible only by parsing its record | [`TrustStore::parse`] |
//! | TR2: the issuer chain, its certificates and their AuthorityKeyIdentifier keyIdentifiers | [`IssuerChain::parse`], [`Certificate`] |
//! | TR3: the resolution, per Credential Query and issuer at a time, into the [`AdmittedIssuer`] witness; a malformed `aki` value makes the query invalid; path validation, which returns the refusal of a chain without a path: the path rules of RFC 5280 over the [`extensions`] TR3 processes, and direct trust in a store certificate byte-identical to the chain's first; the anchor a path ends at | [`QueryAuthorities::of`], [`AdmittedIssuer::resolve`], [`IssuerChain::validate_path`], [`TrustStore::anchor`] |
//! | TR5: the facts the wallet records at registration, and the picker's admission from them alone | [`IssuerFacts::at`], [`Admission::of`] over [`IssuerFacts`] |
//!
//! One rule serves both sides: [`QueryAuthorities::admit`] over an [`Issuer`]. The wallet's
//! issuer is the chain and the store at a time, the picker's the recorded [`IssuerFacts`].
//!
//! Without the feature `chain` the crate holds the rule, the authorities and the facts: what the
//! credential picker links. It builds with Rust 1.82 and holds no X.509 or ECDSA code.
