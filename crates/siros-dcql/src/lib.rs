//! Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL), as defined by
//! [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations 1.0][oid4vp] §6.
//!
//! A DCQL query is how a verifier states what it wants. It carries a list of
//! [`CredentialQuery`] entries — each constrained by format, type and claims —
//! and optionally a list of [`CredentialSetQuery`] entries expressing which
//! *combinations* of those would satisfy the request. A query is constructed only by parsing.
//!
//! [`execute`] evaluates such a query against anything implementing
//! [`Credential`], with format and metadata matching delegated to a
//! [`Policy`] — §6.1 defines `meta` per credential format, so a generic
//! engine cannot interpret it. The crate does no I/O and has no opinion about
//! how credentials are stored, which is what lets the same engine run inside
//! a WebAssembly sandbox, in a Kotlin wallet, and in a Swift one.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! [`query`] is the wire model (§6.1–6.3), [`authority`] its `trusted_authorities`
//! (§6.1.1), [`path`] resolves claims path pointers (§7), and [`eval`] performs selection
//! (§6.4).
//!
//! # Shared vocabulary
//!
//! The request vocabulary the SIROS wallet core's components share is defined here, once:
//! [`QueryId`], [`ClaimPath`], the credential type identifiers [`DocType`] and [`Vct`], and
//! [`TrustedAuthorities`] with its [`AuthorityType`] and [`AuthorityValue`]. The crate depends
//! on no other workspace crate, so that it publishes on its own.
//!
