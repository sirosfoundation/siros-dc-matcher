//! The metadata the host holds for transaction data (PaSO Proof Metadata, Sections 6 and 8). The
//! host fetches and renews it outside presentations, because a fetch during a presentation
//! tells the publisher which credential is presented. The wallet verifies each document every
//! time it loads it.
//!
//! What the host holds, for each credential:
//!
//! - the issuer metadata of its configuration, in the [`DisplayCache`];
//! - when that configuration names a `credential_metadata_uri`, the signed credential metadata
//!   JWT it serves, fetched with `Accept: application/jwt` and the wallet's language as
//!   `Accept-Language`, and admitted by [`HeldJwt::verify_fetched`] with the URL it answered
//!   from; the host renews it before the [`Renewal`]'s expiry, from the URL the [`Renewal`]
//!   names (Section 8);
//! - when the credential is an SD-JWT VC whose `vct` is an `https` URL, the Type Metadata at that
//!   URL and the documents its `transaction_data_types` entries reference (EC TS12 v1.0.1,
//!   Section 4.1). The credential's `#integrity` claims pin them, so they change only with the
//!   credential;
//! - when the credential carries no `x5c` chain, its issuer's JWT VC Issuer Metadata and the key
//!   set its `jwks_uri` names (SD-JWT VC, Section 4.3).
//!
//! A document whose fetch answered 404 the host records as absent ([`HeldDocument::absent`]):
//! the wallet tells a document the issuer does not publish from one the host never fetched,
//! which it does not read as absent. [`HeldMetadata::wanted`] lists what the host should hold
//! for a credential and does not.
