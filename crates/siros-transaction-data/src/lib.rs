//! OpenID4VP 1.0 transaction data for the SIROS wallet core, on the PaSO model (PaSO Core, View
//! and Proof Metadata, draft 2), with the four types of EC TS12 v1.0.1 as built-in rulebooks.
//!
//! | Requirement | API |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | One definition form: a `transaction_data_types` entry (Proof Metadata, Section 3), its labels typed by role, their limits and character rules set by the source ([`LabelRules`]: PaSO's Section 3.3, or TS12's Section 3.3.3), its structural rules (Section 3.3) | [`Definition`], [`ClaimDefinition`], [`UiLabels`], [`LabelText`], [`ValueType`] |
//! | Sources, each a parser into it: the signed credential metadata JWT (Sections 4 and 7), TS12 v1.0.1 type metadata (`lang` → `locale`, `label` → `name`, `visualisation` as [`Prominence`]), the host's [`Configuration`], and the entry's ad-hoc metadata JWT (Section 5). Ad-hoc first; then the credential's own metadata, which declares every type it supports and fails closed; else, for a credential known to have no metadata of its own, the configuration | [`SourceKind`], [`Configuration::parse`] |
//! | Metadata is input: the host holds signed credential metadata, Type Metadata and key sets, resolved and renewed outside presentations, and records what is absent (Proof Metadata, Sections 6 and 8); the wallet verifies each every time it loads it | [`HeldMetadata`], [`HeldDocument::absent`], [`HeldJwt::admit`], [`HeldMetadata::wanted`] |
//! | The projection to the wallet's language: one entry per array, made only by the locale function (View, Section 4), with its source and rulebook, written deterministically and read back | [`Definition::project`], [`Projected::to_json`], [`Projected::parse`], [`SourceInputs::served`] |
//! | T1: entries: base64url JSON without repeated names, `type`, `credential_ids` of DCQL query ids, `payload`, ad-hoc `metadata`, `transaction_data_hashes_alg` as an array or CS-12's string | [`Entry::parse`] |
//! | The request's rules: PaSO-targeted entries only in a signed request (Core, Section 3); the targeted queries in one credential set, its alternatives transposable (Core, Section 7.4.1) | [`check_request`] |
//! | Payload conformance: coverage, `#integrity` companions of images, mandatory claims, value types (Core, Section 7.4.2; View, Section 3) | [`PayloadFault`], [`Scalar`] |
//! | Images, by their form: a base64 Data URL of PNG, JPEG or SVG of at most 512 KiB, or an `https` URL with the integrity values of its `#integrity` sibling, which a TS12 logo may lack (View, Section 3; TS12, Section 4.3.1); over the Digital Credentials API, a Data URL of a format Credential Manager shows. The view carries each image to the UI, which resolves, verifies and renders it; the core resolves and verifies no image content. A TS12 logo that is not admitted is left out | [`Image`], [`ImageRef`], [`Channel`], [`ImageFault`], [`TransactionView::absent_images`] |
//! | Generic rendering: rows in claims order, `null` paths, `template:` as segments of text and typed values, label limits after interpolation, at most 200 items, `security_hint` as given (View, Section 2) | [`TransactionView`], [`Segment`], [`RenderFault`] |
//! | Selection: each candidate credential takes its first compatible entry (Core, Section 7.4.2) | [`Selector::first_match`] over [`Definitions`], [`Context::first_match`], [`Selection`] |
//! | The registration of a credential's sources: for each type a source names, the projected definition or why there is none, and one reason for every other type (K1); the picker's selection over it, which defers to the wallet an entry with ad-hoc metadata (K2) | [`SourceInputs::served_types`], [`ServedTypes`], [`Unserved`], [`Selector::first_match_unverified`], [`Deferral`] |
//!
//! Every refusal of a request is a [`TransactionDataError`]; every reason an entry does not
//! serve a credential is an [`Incompatibility`].
//!
//! Without the default feature `wallet` the crate holds the selection over a registration for the
//! credential picker (K2): definitions, the projection reader, payload conformance, selection over
//! [`Definitions`], and rendering. It links no X.509, ECDSA or trust code. The picker cannot
//! verify an entry's ad-hoc metadata JWT, which needs the trust store: the wallet verifies it
//! after the pick.
