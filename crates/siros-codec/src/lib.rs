//! The encodings every SIROS wallet core crate shares: a strict CBOR reader and deterministic
//! writer, the strict JSON reader (feature `json`), unpadded base64url, the padded
//! base64 of JOSE certificates, the calendar dates and UTC times of CBOR's `full-date` and
//! `tdate`, the ES256 signature value, and the `https` URL of a host fetch.
//!
//! It also holds the internals several components share: [`MemberFault`](member::MemberFault),
//! the member fault of a decoded structure; the [`position!`] and [`text_value!`] macros that
//! declare value newtypes; and [`CertificateChain`](chain::CertificateChain), the DER
//! certificate chain an mdoc `x5chain` and an `x5c` carry.
//!
//! Nothing here panics on any input: the matcher runs this code inside the credential picker,
//! where a trap reads as "no matching credential".

// Nothing panics outside the tests. scripts/check_panic_sites.py refuses an
// allow of these lints there and finds the panics they cannot see.
